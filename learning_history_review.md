##Reviewing My Learning History##
###Questions###

* **What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you as a learner during WDI?**

	The simple fact that I have worked for so long in fields that I have a strong background in may make starting to learn at the most basic level of a new discipline a little overwhelming.

* **How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?**

	Have confidence that I won't always be a noob, and continually remind myself that being out of your comfort zone is a good thing.

* **What learning tactics or approaches do you feel have most benefitted you as a student?**

	I've noticed I respond best to concepts that I can put into some visual or spatial representation...even if it means something as simple as imagining a git respository as a physical space or a circle on a page, as opposed to a file hierarchy. Also, I retain concepts best when I'm forced to use them myself and understand why and when I would use them. I noticed in our prework that if I struggle to solve a problem on my own before looking up the answer (or discovering the answer myself) I'm much more likely to retain the information than if I just read it or are told something.

* **Can you think of any strategies to increase the output or viability of these approaches in the context of WDI? (No idea is too crazy.)**

	I think using my notebook to diagram concepts by hand would help as far as visualy representing concepts. Also, to remember never to just assume I understane something without testing it in a real situation.

* **What is your greatest fear as a WDI student?**

	Naturally, I'm a little concerned that coding might not be something that I'm hardwired to be great at, but I think this is just a fear of the unknown...I think.

* **Is this fear valid? If so, does it serve you as someone learning to program?**

	Probably not. If the passion and desire it there, I think that hard work and patience are more important than any innate ability or skill set.
